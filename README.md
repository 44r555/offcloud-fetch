## Making money with Offcloud.com

The affiliates system of Offcloud.com is very simple yet efficient and transparent. You are given a unique referral code that you can use with the Fetch Integration. Once someone goes to an Offcloud.com link using your integration, he or she receives a cookie that will make sure he or she is identified as one of your referred users.

Whenever one of your referred users joins Offcloud and spends money with us, you are given the same sum as Offcloud Credit. You can use it to get a paid membership for free.

You are also given 33% of the revenue your referred users bring to us, so if a referral pays $59.99, you will earn $19.79. Once your cash equivalent has reached $25, you will be able to withdraw it through PayPal or Bitcoin. You may also contact us if you seek another withdrawal payment method.

In conclusion, our affiliation system coupled with the Fetch Integration allows you both to unlock free membership by inviting your website visitors or app users, and to earn some cash on the money spent by them.
